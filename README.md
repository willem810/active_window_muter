# active_window_muter
This application will mute the current active window.

## Instalation
1) If not already installed, first install NirCMD by running: "InstallNirCMD.bat"

2) Set your Hotkey in "param.txt"

3) Finally, run "Install.bat" to create the hotkey

----

It's possible to run "Install.bat" multiple time, updating the hotkey in "param.txt"

!! "InstallNirCMD.bat" is not optimised so it's recommended to run that script only once !!
